Hacking License
===============

Our Curiosity serves Humanity through Freedom, Candor and Communion.

This license grants you the right to hack with us, to explore ways we ignore
and to challenge our assumptions by teaching us what you will learn.


1. Definitions
--------------
For the purpose of this License:

- "License" refers to this License.
- "Copyright" refers to the transferable rights that copyright-like
  laws assign to the authors of a literary work.
- "Hack" refers to the software, the documentation and the contents
  distributed under this License.
- "Hacker" refers to any Copyright holder of the Hack.
- "Human" is every live being with humans among its genetic ancestors.
- "Application" refers to a set of programs exchanging data.
- "Runtime" refers to any runtime system, any operating system, any
  virtual machine and/or any interpreter that is required to run the Hack.
- The adverb "unconditionally" excludes further constraints and requirements,
  including, but not limited to, further agreements, royalties or other fee.
- "Source" refers to the human-readable form of a software which is the
  most convenient for people to study and modify, and that can be used
  to generate a new identical copy of the software itself.
- "User" refers to any Human receiving a copy of the Hack and/or its
  Source, and/or performing any action permitted by this License.
- "Required Tools" refers to the documentation and the software required for
  the fruition of the rights granted by this License that are not part of the
  Runtime or unconditionally available by other reasonable means to every User.
- To "study" a software means to perform any activity that could help
  the User to deeply understand it, to understand how to modify it or to
  explain its usage and inner working to other Users.
- To "copy" means to create a new exact copy of a work, for any purpose
  and on any medium, even after applying any lossless transformation to it,
  including, but not limited to, compression or encryption.
- To "convey" means to perform any action that might enable other Humans
  to copy a work and/or to obtain or receive copies of it.
- To "distribute" means any action that enables any other Human to perform
  any of the activities permitted by this License.
- To "use" a software means to generate a new copy of the software from
  its Source, to run it for any purpose, to install it, to interact with
  it through any medium or proxy (even asynchronously), to provide data
  used for its input or to consume its output (or any part of it), to
  perform it in public or privately, and/or to store and run a Derived Work
  in place of the software itself.
- To "wrap" a software means to integrate it into an Application.
  The programs that collect, store, transform and/or transfer data
  for the User or between the User and the Hack are called "Wrappers".
  Wrappers do not include any program or library that Users can find in
  off-the-shelf distributions of the Runtime, but include any modified
  version of such programs and libraries, if used to run the Application.
  The license of a Wrapper is compatible with this License if it
  unconditionally grants to the Users access to the Wrapper's Source and the
  right to study, copy, use, wrap, modify, convey and/or distribute the Wrapper
  and/or the Application and/or any modified version of them, in any form.
- To "modify" a software means to perform any action that would require
  Copyright permission, except for studying, copying, using, wrapping
  conveying and distributing the software, including, but not limited to,
  to adapt all or part of the software, to translate all or part of it to
  a different language or form, to create or modify its documentation,
  to refactor its Source, or to combine the software or parts of it with
  other works. The resulting work is called a "Derived Work", whereas
  "Inspiring Hacks" are the original works modified to create it.


2. Grants
---------
Subject to the Conditions below:

1. Permission is hereby granted to any User of the Hack to study, copy,
   use, wrap, modify, convey and/or distribute the Hack, and to distribute
   any Derived Work under this License but clearly informing recipients
   about the differences with the Hack.

2. A patent license to perform each and every of the actions permitted
   above is granted to any User under the Hackers' essential patent claims.

3. If the Hack is a Derived Work, the Hackers grant to the Copyright holders
   of the Inspiring Hacks all permissions and patent licenses granted to the
   Users of the Hack, and all rights, title and interests in any Copyright
   the Hackers have in the Hack to the extent permitted by Law.

4. Organizations may copy and/or convey the Hack and its Source on behalf of
   their members and under this License. No other permission is granted
   to organizations.

All of these grants are free of charge, non-exclusive, valid everywhere
in the Universe, irrevocable (provided the stated Conditions are met),
royalty-free and can be transferred to other Humans with the Hack,
its Source or any Derived Work for no charge.

This License does not grant any rights in the names, trade names,
trademarks, service marks, or logos of the Hackers, except as required
for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Hack
and reproducing the content of the copyright notice.


3. Conditions
-------------
All grants and permissions provided by this License are subject to the
following conditions:

1. The Hackers' copyright notice and this License shall be included in
   all copies or substantial portions of the Hack and of any Derived Work.
2. The Source of the Hack shall be made available with the Hack and/or by other
   reasonable means to every User, unconditionally and under this License.
3. All Wrappers used to integrate the Hack into an Application are 
   unconditionally available (either with the Hack and/or by other reasonable
   means) to every User under either this License or compatible ones, so that
   Users can modify and/or run the whole Application on their own hardware.
4. The Required Tools shall be made available to every User unconditionally.
5. No expedient, restriction or impediment, neither technical, legal or
   otherwise, shall prevent, hinder or inhibit the fruition of the rights
   granted by this License to any User.
6. No expedient, restriction or impediment, neither technical, legal or
   otherwise, shall enable any third party to prevent, hinder or inhibit
   the fruition of the rights granted by this License to any User of
   the Hack or to any User of any Derived Work.
7. No patent infringement litigation claim (excluding counterclaims and
   cross-claims) alleging that all or part of the Hack directly or indirectly
   infringes a patent shall be initialized by the User or on User's behalf.
8. No infringement of the Hackers' Copyright on the Hack can be attributed to
   the User or to any organization operating on his behalf.
9. All of the Definitions, the Grants and the Conditions of this License
   shall be valid and enforceable under the jurisdiction of the User.


4. Termination
--------------
Failing to comply to the conditions of this License shall automatically
terminate the grants provided, without affecting other parties who have
received copies, permissions, patent licenses or rights under this License.


5. Severability
---------------
The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this License does
not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of this License.
Such provision is to be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make
it valid and enforceable.
